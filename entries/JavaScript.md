#JavaScript

Alongside [HTML](/wiki/html) and [CSS](/wiki/css), JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.

JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and [Java](/wiki/java), including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
